# findparkingdc

This app allows you to either find a parking spot near you or report an open parking spot. It was created for the DC Social Media Week Prototyping event. It is only a prototype and was made to demonstrate a method of solving the frustrating problem of finding a parking spot in DC through crowdsourcing.

How it works:

Submitting a parking spot: If you see an open parking spot you simply click "Submit parking spot" and the app will take your GPS coordinates and add them to a database of parking spots.

Finding a parking spot: Click find parking spot and the app will take your GPS coordinates and show you a map of all the parking spots near you that have been submitted by others as well as directions to the nearest spot.
